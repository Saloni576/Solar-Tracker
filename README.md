# Solar Tracker Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to compare the power generation of a solar panel equipped with a solar tracker against a stationary solar panel. The solar tracker adjusts the panel's orientation throughout the day to maximize sunlight exposure, while the stationary panel remains fixed at a set angle. At the end of the day, we will analyze and compare the power output of both setups to determine the effectiveness of the solar tracker in maximizing energy generation. This project aims to demonstrate the superiority of a solar tracker in maximizing energy generation compared to a fixed-angle setup. Arduino code is utilized to control the servo motor for precise panel positioning.

## Components Required
- Arduino Uno microcontroller
- Photodiodes - 2 (for light detection)
- 10k resistors - 2 (for photodiode circuit)
- SG90 servo motor (for panel orientation)
- Jumper wires (for connections)
- Solar panel (for power generation)
- USB cable for Arduino (for programming and power)
- Thermocol (for mounting and insulation)
